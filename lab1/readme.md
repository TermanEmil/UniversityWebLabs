# Lab 1
In this laboratory work I learned about bootstrap and its grid-responsive features.

Applying bootstrap classes, I've created 3 pages and changed some of default bootstrap classes.

Contain a navigation bar, that was simply copied in each *html* file.

For the home page
 Here I created 2 containers with content which have different sizes on Medium, Small and Extra small screens.  
 * For medium screens (normal size of screen): containers are placed on half screen each.
 * For small: 8 x 4 columns.
 * For extra small (for phones for example), each element fills the entire screen's width.
